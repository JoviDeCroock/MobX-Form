# Running

1. `yarn` or `npm i`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm link`
4. `npm link mobx-formstate` in a project.

It's also possible to use `yarn workspaces`, this is just an example on how to get you started.

Now every `npm run build` will trigger a rebuild of target project because you have a symlink to your build.
