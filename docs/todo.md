# Todo

- Tests
  - component testing
- React
  - use new context api
- Form
  - name form so we can recover formState if the consumer wants this
- FieldGroup
  - handle props (!) --> analyse workflow for this
  - remove field (!) --> values without having a field --> has to be tested and option should be given on field for destroy or not.
  - add field (!) --> adding fields on the fly --> has to be tested
  - enumerate fields, tabIndex etc
