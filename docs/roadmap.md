To make the development off this project a little less overwhelming i splitted it up in a bunch off mini tasks

- Make the `Field` work by spreading the props into a Component
- Make the `Field` work with a HOC
- Make our `Form` submittable
- implement validators
- Ensure consumers can use thirth party validators
- implement `FieldGroup`

In the `todo.md` there's a bunch off splitted tasks
