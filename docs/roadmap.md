To make the development off this project a little less overwhelming i splitted it up in a bunch off mini tasks

1. Make the `Field` work by spreading the props into a Component
2. Make the `Field` work with a HOC
3. Make our `Form` submittable and handle Errors
4. implement validators
5. Ensure consumers can use thirth party validators
6. implement `FieldGroup`

In the `todo.md` there's a bunch off splitted tasks
