As someone really inspired by how modern libraries improve and influence our way of development i decided to make a form library inspired by the way redux-form handles forms.

Inspired by [redux form](https://redux-form.com/)
Powered by [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/)

## Need

When working with MobX i noticed that there were a variety off well-written libraries to my disposal but not really one that would do all the formhandling under the hood, that's how i got to this side project.
